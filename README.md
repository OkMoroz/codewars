# Codewars

Codewars is a platform where you can sharpen your coding skills through engaging challenges called katas. Here's how Codewars typically works:

## Kata
A kata is a coding challenge that you need to solve. Each kata comes with a description, sample input, and expected output.

## Ranking
Codewars uses a ranking system based on kyu and dan. Kyu represents the difficulty level (higher kyu means easier), and dan represents the skill level (higher dan means more advanced).

## Solutions
After solving a kata, you can submit your solution and explore other solutions submitted by the community. Codewars encourages users to discuss and collaboratively improve solutions.

## Honour
Users earn honor points for completing katas and achieving higher ranks. This contributes to their overall profile and ranking on the platform.

## Clans
Codewars also allows users to form or join clans, which are groups of users working together to solve challenges and compete with other clans.
